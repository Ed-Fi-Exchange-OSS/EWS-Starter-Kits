## Contributing

The Ed-Fi Alliance welcomes code contributions from the community. Please read
the [Ed-Fi Contribution
Guidelines](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/Code+Contribution+Guidelines)
for detailed information on how to contribute source code.

Looking for an easy way to get started? Search for tickets with label
"up-for-grabs" in [Tracker](https://tracker.ed-fi.org/browse/EXC);
these are nice-to-have but low priority tickets that should not
require in-depth knowledge of the code base and architecture.
